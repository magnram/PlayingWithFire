# PlayingWithFire
My JavaFX game, made spring 2018

This is my very first game made in JavaFX. You can find the game.jar file at 
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mOq4T9PutoL0WaSJAhfa-ihp1gfIbpsj/view?fbclid=IwAR2c8ad7k3f_5QoVS3bRDya3LlTb2qcp4OGbk-_avkZK0K6Fm7sSAe6pz_k


**EDIT:** The JAR-file doesn't seem to work on all computers, but below you can see some actual gameplay. A lot of time was also spent making the menu and leaderboard functionality, which can be displayed if you run the project.
